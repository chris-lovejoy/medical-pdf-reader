    ## ABOUT
    This app extracts information from medical record PDFs into a structured **clinical JSON format‚Ñ¢Ô∏è** (patent pending*).
    
    ---

    This enables you to:
    - **Extract specific information** contained within the medical record
    - **Ask questions** about content within the medical record
    - **Use clinical reasoning** to assess medical decisions made in the record
    
    ---

    The **clinical JSON format** is a single-level JSON document with the following fields:
    - chief_complaint
    - medications
    - allergies
    - family_history
    - physical_examination
    - treatment_plan
    
    You can see an example [here](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/medical-pdf-reader/blob/main/tests/example.json).    
    
    ---

    NOTE: At present, this only supports PDFs up to 3-4 pages.
